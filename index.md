This lesson aims to introduce basic benchmarking on HPC systems to help users make the most
efficient use of any resources they have been awarded on the system.

The lesson aims to answer the following questions:
  - Why should I benchmark (and potentially profile) my use of research software on HPC systems?
  - How do I measure performance and which metrics should I use and when?
  - What is a good approach to benchmark my use of a particular package?
  - How can I automate the process of benchmarking and collating results?
  - What can basic profiling show me and how can I access this information?  

> ## Prerequisites
> You should have used remote HPC facilities before. In particular, you should be happy with connecting
> using SSH, know what a batch scheduling system is and be familiar with using the Linux command line.
> You should also be happy editing plain text files in a remote terminal (or, alternatively, editing them
> on your local system and copying them to the remote HPC system using `scp`).

> ## Requirements
> Participants must bring a laptop with a Mac, Linux, or Windows operating system (not a tablet,
> Chromebook, etc.) that they have administrative privileges on. They should have a few specific software
> packages installed (listed in the Setup section below). They are also required to abide by the
> [ARCHER2 Training Code of Conduct](https://www.archer2.ac.uk/training/code-of-conduct/).

Note that this lesson uses [The Carpentries](https://carpentries.org) template but this is not a
